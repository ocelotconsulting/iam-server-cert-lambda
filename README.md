# letsencrypt-iam-lambda
An AWS Lambda function to take a received S3 event, and update a related certificate in AWS IAM.

## Status
Just starting, but this project will serve as a follow-on project to
[node-letsencrypt-lambda](https://github.com/ocelotconsulting/node-letsencrypt-lambda), helping to further the
automation of configuring SSL certificates in AWS.
